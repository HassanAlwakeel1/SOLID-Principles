# Introduction to SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Design

## Overview
In software development, Object-Oriented Design (OOD) plays a crucial role in writing flexible, scalable, maintainable, and reusable code. OOD is a paradigm that focuses on modeling software systems as a collection of objects that interact with each other to accomplish tasks. One of the key principles of OOD is the SOLID principle, introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob. The SOLID principle serves as a coding standard for good object-oriented design in programming, ensuring that software systems are well-structured, easy to understand, and maintainable over time.

## SOLID Principles Belong to OOD
The SOLID principles are fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Design (OOD). They provide guidelines for designing software systems that are modular, flexible, and easy to maintain. Each SOLID principle addresses specific aspects of OOD, promoting best practices for creating software that is robust and scalable.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is like playing with a set of building blocks. Each building block represents a different piece of code, like functions, variables, and classes. With OOP, you can use these building blocks to create all sorts of cool things, like robots, castles, or airplanes. You can give each creation its own unique features and behaviors. For example, a robot can walk, talk, and shoot lasers from its eyes!

## Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is like being an architect designing a new house. Before you start building, you need to create a blueprintâ€”a detailed plan that shows how the house will look and function. OOD involves thinking carefully about how all the different parts of your program will fit together and interact. You need to consider things like what rooms the house will have, how they'll be arranged, and how people will move between them. Similarly, in OOD, you think about how different modules or components of your software will work together, how data will flow between them, and how you'll organize your code to make it easy to understand and maintain.

## Highlights
ðŸ”‘ **SOLID principles** are crucial for designing software systems within the Object-Oriented Design paradigm.  
ðŸ“š SOLID is an acronym representing five important design principles.  
ðŸ’¡ The order of the principles is not significant; it's just a mnemonic device.  
ðŸŽ¯ This section will discuss each principle in detail.  

## Relation between OOP and OOD
While OOP is about using code to create fun and interactive objects, OOD is about planning and designing your software system to make sure everything works smoothly and efficiently, just like designing a house before you build it.

## SOLID Principles (Five Principles)

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job or responsibility.

### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open-Closed Principle states that software entities (such as classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a client should not be forced to implement interfaces that it doesn't use. Instead of having one large interface, it's better to have multiple smaller interfaces.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
