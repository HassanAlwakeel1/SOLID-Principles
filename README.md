# SOLID-Principles

## Highlights
ðŸ”‘ **SOLID principles** are crucial for designing software systems.  
ðŸ“š SOLID is an acronym representing five important design principles.  
ðŸ’¡ The order of the principles is not significant; it's just a mnemonic device.  
ðŸŽ¯ This section will discuss each principle in detail.

## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job or responsibility.

### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open-Closed Principle states that software entities (such as classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In simpler terms, derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a client should not be forced to implement interfaces that it doesn't use. Instead of having one large interface, it's better to have multiple smaller interfaces.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

These principles, when applied effectively, contribute to the development of software that is easier to maintain, understand, and extend. Each principle addresses specific aspects of software design, promoting flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.
