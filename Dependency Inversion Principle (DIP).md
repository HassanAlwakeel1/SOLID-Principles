# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 🎛️

The **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It was introduced by Robert C. Martin and it states that:

> "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."

In simpler terms, this means:

1. **High-level modules** (the policy-setting modules) should not depend on **low-level modules** (the detail-oriented modules). Instead, both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes).
2. **Abstractions** should not depend on the details. The details should depend on the abstractions.

## Key Points ✨

1. **Decoupling** 🔗
   - Decouples high-level and low-level modules, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.
   
2. **Abstractions** 🎭
   - Use interfaces or abstract classes to create a layer of abstraction that both high-level and low-level modules depend on.

3. **Flexibility** 🌈
   - Promotes flexibility and reuse by allowing the implementation details to change without affecting high-level modules.

## Benefits 🎉

- **Improved Maintainability** 🛠️
   - Changes in low-level modules do not impact high-level modules.
   - High-level modules can focus on policy and decision-making.

- **Enhanced Testability** ✔️
   - High-level modules can be tested independently from low-level module implementations by using mocks or stubs.

- **Increased Reusability** ♻️
   - Low-level modules can be reused across different high-level modules since they depend on abstractions.

## Example 🌟

Consider a simple application that sends messages. Without DIP, the high-level module (`MessageService`) depends directly on the low-level module (`EmailSender`).

### Without DIP ❌

```java
public class EmailSender {
    public void sendEmail(String message) {
        // Code to send email
    }
}

public class MessageService {
    private EmailSender emailSender;

    public MessageService() {
        this.emailSender = new EmailSender();
    }

    public void send(String message) {
        emailSender.sendEmail(message);
    }
}
```
### With DIP ✅
Using DIP, we introduce an abstraction (`MessageSender`) and make both (`MessageService`) and (`EmailSender`) depend on this abstraction.
```java
public interface MessageSender {
    void sendMessage(String message);
}

public class EmailSender implements MessageSender {
    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        // Code to send email
    }
}

public class SmsSender implements MessageSender {
    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        // Code to send SMS
    }
}

public class MessageService {
    private MessageSender messageSender;

    public MessageService(MessageSender messageSender) {
        this.messageSender = messageSender;
    }

    public void send(String message) {
        messageSender.sendMessage(message);
    }
}
```

By modifying `MessageService` to depend on the `MessageSender` interface rather than specific implementations like `EmailSender` or `SmsSender`, you've achieved decoupling. Now, `MessageService` is agnostic to the actual implementation details of sending messages. It only knows that it needs something that implements the `MessageSender` interface to send messages.

This allows you to easily swap out implementations of `MessageSender` without modifying `MessageService`. For example, you can use `EmailSender`, `SmsSender`, or any other class that implements `MessageSender`, without changing the code of `MessageService`.

This flexibility and decoupling make your code easier to maintain, extend, and test, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
